We recently just had our first visit to the Cystic Fibrosis center at Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta. We were told that right after a child is diagnosed with cystic fibrosis, the CF center wants to see them within 48 hours.
 
Jenn and I went with Finn and my parents. It was great having a few extra ears to help pick up the information because there was quite a bit of information. We were there for a little over 4 or 5 hours.

Everyone was super nice and introduced themselves to Jenn and I and let us know that we will be getting to know them well. When a CF patient is younger they will have more visits to the center than when they get a little bit older. We will be visiting it once a month.

When we first went went back they took his vitals: weight, length, oxygen, etc.

The first person we spoke to was Dr. Guglani. He is a pulmonologist and currently researches and studies cystic fibrosis in infants. One of the first things he said before he told us anything else was pretty shocking and encouraging:

The cure is on the horizon and I’m quite confident that Finley will receive that cure.

He said it quite confidently. I hope he’s right. But it’s clear he’s confident because he is currently doing research on the subject. There’s reason for hope though. Just 40-50 years ago CF patients wouldn’t get past 6 years old. Now, the average life expectancy is 40 years old. That’s a big jump in a relatively small amount of time.

 
Dr. Guglani spoke with us for about an hour or so and covered just about everything you could imagine about CF. He informed us that Finn has the most common gene mutation of CF which is the delta F508. This mutation accounts for about 70% of all CF patients. The mutations don’t really mean that much right now. People with one mutation are not worse than other people with a different mutation, it’s just a different mutation.
 
He also let us know that CF patients can’t be around each other. Cystic Fibrosis is the only disease where the patients can’t be around each other.
 
>“The sad but true news is that cystic fibrosis patients do pose a threat to each other. That’s because they carry specific types of antibiotic-resistent bacteria in their lungs that, if swapped, can cause lung infection. And chronic infection leads to lung damage which can shorten a CF patient’s life span.”

He said that in the 80’s it was really popular to have camps where CF patients could spend time around each other and hang out. When they held these camps, epidemics broke out. They learned that CF patients are contagious to each other. That’s why if there is ever a CF benefit or run or anything like that, there can only be 1 pre-approved CF patient present. It’s crazy.
 
He went over different things that we will have to do with Finley both now and later on in his life. It was great to hear everything and know that he will act and look just like a normal child. He even said that as much as about 10 years ago you could look at a child and recognize that they have CF, but not now.

After he spoke with us, Kaeti came in. Kaeti is the nutritionist and spent a great amount of time going over what Finley will need to eat. She went in to a good amount of detail as to why he needs to eat what he eats. One of the main problems with CF patients is that they have a thick mucus that lines their lungs and blocks their enzymes which help in breaking down the food and getting the nutrients they need. So Finn has prescription enzymes that he has to take before every meal as well as prescription vitamins that he has to take every day as well.

Salt is a big part of CF patients diets. They eat a lot of it. So Finn needs about 1/8 a teaspoon of salt every day which is the exact size of the small packets of salt you see at fast food restaurants. We grab a handful every time we see them, lol. It’s great to know that he is fine to eat any food at all and actually will need to eat more high calorie foods. They encourage them to eat foods that most people will stay away from: pizza with extra cheese, burgers with bacon and cheese, milkshakes, add extra butter to food, omelets with extra cheese or ham and bacon. Yeah, pretty cool. I’ll have to do another post on food in the future. The whole idea is that they don’t process food as well as normal people, so they need to eat more calories to get the same amount of nutrients.

After Kaeti, we had a CF nurse come in and talk about a bunch of different things. She went over some paperwork and talked about medicine and what not. Lastly, a respiratory specialist came in for just a minute and gave us a handout about doing chest compressions on Finn. They will talk about that in more detail on the next visit.

Overall it was a great visit. A long visit, but a good one. As they say, “Knowledge is power.” It’s so much better knowing all that we know. Now we just have to process all of it.
Thanks for reading this and going on this journey with us. When we learn more we will post it here.
